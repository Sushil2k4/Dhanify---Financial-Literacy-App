## Problem Statement 🕵️‍♂️

### Financial Literacy Crisis: A Barrier to Economic Prosperity 💸🚧

**The Problem:** Financial literacy is shockingly low among young adults, mainly due to its absence from mainstream education. This lack of financial know-how results in poor money management, escalating debt, and insufficient investment in future security. With only 24% of millennials having basic financial knowledge, the gap is glaring, leading to increased poverty rates and economic instability. We urgently need a solution that makes financial education accessible and engaging for all.

## Introduction 🌟

The financial literacy crisis is a major hurdle for young adults who are often ill-equipped to handle real-world financial challenges. Despite its importance, financial education is frequently sidelined in schools, leaving students without essential skills for managing their finances effectively. This results in poor financial decisions, mounting debt, and inadequate investment for the future, impacting both individuals and the broader economy.
